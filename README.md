### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My (first and legal) name is David Cody. 


About me: I am an Honors College freshman at Michigan State University pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Statistics actively seeking 2022 summer internship opportunities for software engineering or data science.

What I'm up to:

### Research
- [] I conduct research under Dr. Ghassemi's Human and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory! The project I lead, [Osprey](https://github.com/BumbleIV/osprey), involves of involves a Raspberry Pi network of IoT that collects then streams various forms of haptic data to a server where several RL algorithms or LFD algorithms can be applied utilizing the gathered information to uncover hidden elements and aspects of the IoT's environment. I frequently work with languages, frameworks, and other relevant tools such as Python, Flask, BASH, TensorFlow, and IoT.

### Internship(s)
- [] As a Data Analyst intern for Michigan State University's College of Engineering Career Center, I lead the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Survey. This project involves the construction of a simple Qualtrics survey to be distributed amongst multiple companies of our interest. These companies will provide numerics on their employee demographics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, etc. that will be processed to visually inform employment-seeking MSU students' decisions. I frequently work with languages, frameworks, and other relevant tools such as Python to clean the data, SQL to manage and store the data, and Tableau to visualize and further investigate the data.

# Side Projects
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a [Connect 4 Reinforcement Learning Agent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcodylingan)
